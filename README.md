# John Leidy II Portfolio Website
## Built using React.js

This website is pretty straight forward. This is the implementation for Netlify. I am currently not using a backend, however I have a codebase with a backend fully implemented. 
That website is on a MERN stack. Below I will add some documentation on specific sections of the website I think are useful for others. Open to suggestions on ways to improve my implementation.

## Code Details Section:
*adding soon*

## Below are screenshots of the website:
